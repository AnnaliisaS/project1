BookHunter - our first project for UW Bootcamp. 

**Description:**
It is a a web search application that returns books based on userâ€™s criteria. A user can input a title, author or keywords and is returned results including the cover image, title, author and first line. Near the data, a user can click a link to find local libraries that might stock the book, click a button to find Amazon results similar to the title and save or hide a story. If a user saves stories, they can be found in the "Saved Stories" page from the navbar. If a user clicks "Local Bookstores", they will be taken through Google to a map showing bookstores near the user's location. 

**User Story:**
As a reader, I want to find a book that meets my search criteria, with the option to disregard those I have already read.
